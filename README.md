Sentiment Analysis with LSTM on IMDB Reviews

Project Overview

This project focuses on sentiment analysis using an LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) model to classify movie reviews from the IMDB dataset as positive or negative. The dataset contains 50,000 reviews labeled as either positive or negative. The project demonstrates various steps including data preprocessing, text vectorization, model building, and evaluation.

Features

Data Preprocessing: Cleaning and preparing text data for modeling.

Text Vectorization: Converting text to sequences using tokenization and padding.

LSTM Model: Building and training an LSTM model for sentiment classification.

Data Visualization: Visualizing the data distribution, word clouds, and model performance.

Model Evaluation: Assessing the model's performance using accuracy, loss, and confusion matrix.

Dataset

IMDB Dataset: This dataset contains 50,000 reviews labeled as positive or negative. It is freely available for download and can be loaded into the project using the provided CSV file.

Results

Accuracy: The model achieves around 85% accuracy on the test set (modify according to your results).

Confusion Matrix: The confusion matrix shows the distribution of true positives, true negatives, and model errors.
